I use MATLAB 2018a to write this code.

The file An_Example.m teaches you how to use the function convolution_withcoordinates.m quickly.
The file convolution_withcoordinates.m is the main function to calculate the convolution.
Other files are the functions needed by the main function convolution_withcoordinates.m.

I use it to check my homework and do some clumsy and boring work. I hope this code can be helpful to you.
Enjoy! :)
If any questions, I am glad to help with. ;)
